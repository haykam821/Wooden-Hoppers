Adds an early-game hopper alternative to Minecraft.

Wooden Hoppers requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Wooden Hoppers from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wooden-hoppers/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Wooden-Hoppers/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

This mod adds wooden hoppers for each type of wood. Their crafting recipe is similar to normal hoppers, but use planks rather than iron ingots.

These hoppers can only contain one stack of items and have a cooldown of 12 ticks rather than 8 ticks.
